# Problem Statement regarding the Project


The current library management system has several challenges that are hindering its efficiency and effectiveness. These challenges include a lack of automation, limited accessibility, poor user experience, and inadequate security measures.

Firstly, the system relies heavily on manual processes, which often results in errors, delays, and inefficiencies. For instance, the manual cataloging of books is time-consuming and prone to errors. Additionally, the current system lacks automation features that could help automate tasks such as book reservations, lending, and returning.

Secondly, the current system's accessibility is limited, as it only allows physical access to the library premises during working hours. This makes it difficult for users who cannot visit the library to access its resources, especially during emergencies.

Thirdly, the user experience of the current system is subpar, with an outdated interface that makes it difficult for users to navigate and find relevant information. This makes it frustrating

for users to use the system, resulting in low user satisfaction.

Finally, the security measures of the current system are inadequate, which puts library

resources at risk of theft or damage. The system does not have proper authentication

protocols, and user data is not encrypted, leaving it vulnerable to unauthorized access

Overall, these challenges demonstrate the need for a more efficient and effective library

management system that is automated, accessible, user-friendly, and secure.
