Future Scope of Project :

The current code for the library management system is a good starting point for managing books and providing a basic interface for users to borrow and return books. However, there are several ways in which the code could be expanded and improved in the future.

One potential area for improvement is to integrate a database system to allow for more efficient storage and retrieval of book information. This would allow for faster searches and more accurate tracking of books, as well as the ability to add additional information such as author, publisher, and publication date. Additionally, incorporating a rating system for books and user reviews could enhance the user experience and help users find books that they may be interested in.

Another potential area for improvement is to add a reservation system for books that are currently checked out. This would allow users to reserve books in advance and ensure that they are available when they want them. Additionally, incorporating a messaging system to allow users to communicate with each other and with the library staff could enhance the overall user experience and provide a more personalized service.

Overall, there are many potential avenues for improvement and expansion of this library management system, and continued development and refinement could lead to a more efficient and user-friendly system for managing books and serving users.
